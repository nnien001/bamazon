# bamazon

Example of MySQL usage and inquirer.

Each .js file runs independently of each other. One is built from the viewpoint of a customer attempting to buy merchanize. The other runs as a manager attempting to control inventory. Should be self explanatory.

To run:
Node bamazonCustomer.js
or
Node bamazonManager.js
